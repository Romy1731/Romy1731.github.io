## About

I am a young French researcher in Conservation Biology, with particular interests in international conservation, conservation effectiveness and birds. My profile combines strong spatial analytic skills (e.g., crossing large database of biodiversity data with habitat data), enthuasiam and ease in academic writing and a naturalist background (mainly birdwatching).

I will soon start a Post-Doc position at [iDiv](https://www.idiv.de/en/sdiv.html), working in the sRedList project to develop an innovative and consistent framework for prioritising the updates of Red List assessments. This project is led by [Luca Santini](http://lucasantini.com/) and [Moreno Di Marco](https://www.biodiversitychange.com). 

From October 2017 to November 2020, I was a PhD student at the [Centre for functional and Evolutionary Ecology](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/en/) in Montpellier, working with [Ana S.L. Rodrigues](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/recherche/bc/dpb/862-c/228-ana-rodrigues) on protected area effectiveness. I graduated on the 9th of November 2020 and my PhD thesis (partly is French) can be found [here](https://mycore.core-cloud.net/index.php/s/nepmFjJyzwXATpl).

When I'm not in the lab, I enjoy hiking (especially in the mountains) and playing music (double bass, piano).

More detail can be found in my detail [CV](/CV Victor 26.10.20b.pdf) (last update October 2020)
