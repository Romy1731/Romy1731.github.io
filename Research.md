### Protected area effectiveness
During my PhD I worked on evaluating the effectiveness of the main tool used in conservation and that is central in international conservation agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity: protected areas. The term "protected area effectiveness" is used with various meanings in the literature because it combines multiple facets that need to be 
is a multifaceted question [(Rodrigues and Cazalis 2020, Nat.Comms)]()

The core of my PhD was to measure the local effect of protected areas: do they make a difference locally for species. I first explored this using a standard dataset (the North American Breeding Bird Survey) and found that protected forests did not present higher overall species richness or abundance than unprotected forests (everything else but protection being equal) but that protection of forests had a positive effect on bird species that favour forest habitats, i.e., they mitigate biotic homogeneisation [(Cazalis et al. 2019, PCI Ecology)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/433037v4.full.pdf). As these types of datasets are concentrating in high-income countries, we have very little information on the local effectiveness of protected areas in tropical regions. Thanks to the emerging eBird database, I show using >65,000 sampling events across eight tropical forest biodiversity hotspots, that protected areas do not affect overall species richness but that they do favour forest-dependent species, endemic species, and threatened and Near Threatened species by mitigating both forest loss and forest degradation [(Cazalis et al. 2020, Nat.Comms)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18230-0). In addition, I collaborated in a study showing that Ramsar (protected areas focusing on wetlands) across the Mediterranean are relatively well-located (Ramsar sites host significantly higher abundances of waterbirds) but have low local effectiveness (Ramsar effect on abundance trends was only found in Maghreb) [(Gaget et al. 2020, Bio.Cons.)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320719315332?dgcid=author).

Following this work on local effect of protected areas, we can wonder how different are protected areas in their effectiveness depending on their surrounding context. We especially wonder how different were bird assemblages in urban protected areas (e.g., National Park of Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro) and in protected areas anchored in a more natural context. In a project using again eBird data, Loïse Huot showed that urban protected areas in Latin America keep an important diversity within their boundaries but that this diversity is reduced compared with non-urban protected areas (lower richness and abundance, lower proportion of forest-dependent species, of narrow-ranged species and threatened or Near Threatened species) except for exotic species that are more abundant in protected areas that are urban (Huot et al. *In prep.*). These results highlight that protected areas are not independent from their context and that mitigating pressures within their boarders won't be sufficient if they are to become islands of natural habitat surrounded by an anthropogenetic matrix.

### Other projects
During my Master, I worked on a theoretical model exploring the balance between human demography, land-use and ecosystem services [Cazalis et al. 2018, Sci.Tot.Env](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.03.360)

I have been also involved, providing statistical support, in a review of the global tracking effort on seabirds, in which we identify species that have never or rarely been tracked and for which the knowledge on migration and wintering behaviours, is lacking (Bernard et al. *Under review*).
