## Research interests

During my PhD I worked on evaluating the effectiveness of the main tool used in conservation and that is central in international conservation agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity: protected areas. The term "protected area effectiveness" is used with various meanings in the literature because it combines multiple facets that need to be 
is a multifaceted question [Rodrigues and Cazalis 2020, Nat.Comms]() 

Relative to network -> Cazalis et al. In prep.

The core of my PhD was to measure the local effect of protected areas: do they make a difference locally for species. I first explored this using a standard dataset (the North American Breeding Bird Survey) and found that protected forests did not present higher overall species richness or abundance than unprotected forests (everything else but protection being equal) but that protection of forests had a positive effect on bird species that favour forest habitats, i.e., they mitigate biotic homogeneisation.
Relative to local effectiveness -> BBS, then use eBird for tropics, then participated in Gaget et al. 
Develop further, difference in PAs -> Loise
Other aspect -> PrÃ©vot
All together used to measure success of international agreements -> Maxwell

During my Master, I worked on a theoretical model exploring the balance between human demography, land-use and ecosystem services [Cazalis et al. 2018, Sci.Tot.Env](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.03.360)

I have been also involved, providing statistical support, in a review of the global tracking effort on seabirds, in which we identify species that have never or rarely been tracked and for which the knowledge on migration and wintering behaviours, is lacking (Bernard et al. *Under review*).
