### Protected area effectiveness
During my PhD I worked on evaluating the effectiveness of the main tool used in conservation and that is central in international conservation agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity: protected areas. The term "protected area effectiveness" is used with various meanings in the literature, related to either the extent of protected areas, the design of the network of protected areas, the resource allocated to protected areas or the local effect of protected areas. These different facets are described, from an historical perspective in a recent comment [(Rodrigues and Cazalis 2020, Nat.Comms)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18989-2) 


The core of my PhD was to measure the local effect of protected areas: do they make a difference locally for species. We first explored this using a standard dataset (the North American Breeding Bird Survey) and found that protected forests did not present higher overall species richness or abundance than unprotected forests (everything else but protection being equal) but that protection of forests had a positive effect on bird species that favour forest habitats, i.e., they mitigate biotic homogeneisation [(Cazalis et al. 2019, PCI Ecology)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/433037v4.full.pdf). As these types of datasets are concentrating in high-income countries, we have very little information on the local effectiveness of protected areas in tropical regions. Thanks to the emerging eBird database, we showed using >65,000 sampling events across eight tropical forest biodiversity hotspots, that protected areas do not affect overall species richness but that they do favour forest-dependent species, endemic species, and threatened and Near Threatened species by mitigating both forest loss and forest degradation [(Cazalis et al. 2020, Nat.Comms)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18230-0). In addition, I collaborated in a study showing that Ramsar (protected areas focusing on wetlands) across the Mediterranean are relatively well-located (Ramsar sites host significantly higher abundances of waterbirds) but have low local effectiveness (Ramsar effect on abundance trends was only found in Maghreb) [(Gaget et al. 2020, Bio.Cons.)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320719315332?dgcid=author).

Following this work on local effect of protected areas, we can wonder how different are protected areas in their effectiveness depending on their surrounding context. We especially wonder how different were bird assemblages in urban protected areas (e.g., National Park of Tijuca in Rio de Janeiro) and in protected areas anchored in a more natural context. In a project using again eBird data, Loïse Huot showed that urban protected areas in Latin America keep an important diversity within their boundaries but that this diversity is reduced compared with non-urban protected areas (lower richness and abundance, lower proportion of forest-dependent species, of narrow-ranged species and threatened or Near Threatened species) except for exotic species that are more abundant in protected areas that are urban (**Huot et al. *In prep.***). These results highlight that protected areas are not independent from their context and that mitigating pressures within their boarders won't be sufficient if they are to become islands of natural habitat surrounded by an anthropogenetic matrix.

The difference in effectiveness of protected areas shown in the previous study, and more broadly the difference in habitat conditions suggests that not all protected areas can conserve all species. In particular, species that are highly sensitive to human pressure can not be expected to be protected by protected areas intensely pressured. Using eBird data, we measured an index of sensitivity for all bird species breeding in the Americas and studied the spatial distribution of sensitivity. We show that ecoregions with high proportion of high-sensitivity species are not more covered by intact protected areas and thus that many high-sensitivity species cannot be effectively conserve by protected areas as their distribution does not intersect (or negligibly) with intact protected areas (**Cazalis et al. *In prep.***).


As a side project to my PhD, I led an interdisciplinary study in Conservation Psychology in which we show that in France, people living close to natural park tend to adopt more pro-environmental behaviours (i.e., voting for green parties, supporting conservation NGOs, participating in citizen science projects). We suggest that protected areas may conserve human connection with nature and enhance pro-environmental behaviours by providing inhabitants with both higher exposure to natural landscape as well as ecological sensitivity through outreach events [(Cazalis and Prévot 2019, Bio.Cons.)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.03.012)

Several of the above-mentioned facets of protected area effectiveness are part of the Aichi Target 11, related to protected areas, that almost all governments have promised to reach by 2020. In a review of the progress towards this target, we show that this none of the subojectives of this target have been met and that governments have underinvested in protected areas in the last decade [(Maxwell et al. 2020, Nature)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2773-z) and we call for the formulation of outcome-based objectives for the post-2020 biodiversity framework.


### Other projects
During my Master, I worked on a theoretical model exploring the balance between human demography, land-use and ecosystem services [(Cazalis et al. 2018, Sci.Tot.Env)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.03.360)

I have been also involved, providing statistical support, in a review of the global tracking effort on seabirds, in which we identify species that have never or rarely been tracked and for which the knowledge on migration and wintering behaviours, is lacking (**Bernard et al. *Under review***).
