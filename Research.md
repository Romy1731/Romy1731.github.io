## Research interests
My main motivation in doing research holds in the word "Conservation". I want my research to help, directly or indirectly, conserving species and nature. This applied will is combined with a strong appetence for large and global spatial scales. Indeed, I like to think about the global impact that humans have on biodiversity and about the solutions that we have in our hands to mitigate biodiversity loss at global scale. Studying conservation effectiveness and participating in the development of indexes to track biodiversity loss and conservation effects are thus central in my research interests. I also feel drawn to social sciences when they help understanding what makes conservation actions more effective and I hope to develop this in the future.


## Research projects
### IUCN Red List improvement
The Red List of threatened species is absolutely central in biodiversity conservation, therefore it is important that it is up-to-date with changes in species risks of extinction. This is currently problematic as many species have not been re-assessed while their last assessment was more than 10 years ago. The objective of the working group my current post-doc fits in is to create a common framework to identify automatically species that need urgent re-assessment, by crossing species distribution, human pressure maps and species traits. It will include synthesis aspects (to identify what has been done), analytical studies (to fill gaps identified in the synthesis) and the definition of a common framework that we hope to be used for further IUCN re-assessments.


### Protected area effectiveness

During my PhD I worked on evaluating the effectiveness of the main tool used in conservation and that is central in international conservation agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity: protected areas. The term "protected area effectiveness" in used in many ways as it incapsulates multiple complementary facets that together explains how protected areas enable the long term conservation of nature [(Rodrigues and Cazalis 2020, Nat.Comms)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18989-2).

The facet most of my PhD focused on is the local effectiveness of protected areas: do they make a difference locally for species. We showed that protected areas do not often affect the local richness of assemblages but that they favour more typical assemblages and thus mitigate biotic homogeneisation. This was the case in a study using a standard dataset (the North American Breeding Bird Survey; [Cazalis et al. 2019, PCI Ecology](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/433037v4.full.pdf)), as well as a study using eBird data from eight tropical forest biodiversity hotspots that showed that protected areas do not affect overall species richness but that they do favour forest-dependent species, endemic species, and threatened species by mitigating both forest loss and forest degradation [(Cazalis et al. 2020, Nat.Comms)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18230-0). Wondering if protected areas' effects vary with the context surrounding them, we show that urban protected areas in Latin America (e.g., National Park of Tijuca) keep an important diversity within their boundaries but that this diversity is reduced compared with non-urban protected areas (lower richness and abundance, lower proportion of forest-dependent species, of narrow-ranged species and of threatened species) except for exotic species that are more abundant in protected areas that are urban (**Huot et al. *In prep.***). In addition, I collaborated in a study showing that Ramsar (protected areas focusing on wetlands) across the Mediterranean host most waterbirds but have low impact on species trends suggesting a poor local effectiveness [(Gaget et al. 2020, Bio.Cons.)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006320719315332?dgcid=author).

In another project we explored the effectiveness of the current protected area network in the Americas at providing intact habitats to species that are the most sensitive to human pressure. We show that ecoregions with high proportion of high-sensitivity species (mainly in the Andes and Central America) are not more covered by intact protected areas and thus that many high-sensitivity species cannot be effectively conserved by protected areas as their distribution does not intersect (or negligibly) with intact protected areas [(Cazalis et al. *Under review*)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.28.437197).

As a side project to my PhD, I led an interdisciplinary study in Conservation Psychology in which we show that in France, people living close to natural park tend to adopt more pro-environmental behaviours (i.e., voting for green parties, supporting conservation NGOs, participating in citizen science projects), suggesting that protected areas may play a role in conservng human connection with nature [(Cazalis and PrÃ©vot 2019, Bio.Cons.)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2019.03.012)

Several of the above-mentioned facets of protected area effectiveness are part of the Aichi Target 11, related to protected areas, that almost all governments have promised to reach by 2020. In a review of the progress towards this target, we show that none of the subojectives of this target have been met and that governments have underinvested in protected areas in the last decade [(Maxwell et al. 2020, Nature)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2773-z) and we call for the formulation of outcome-based objectives for the post-2020 biodiversity framework.


### Other projects
In an ongoing project (**Cazalis *Under review***), I investigate the exact effect of human footprint on overall species richness and on assemblage composition and suggest the existence of a two-phases relationship that I call the "Replace the Remove trajectory". It first consists in a phase of strong assemblage transformation (replacement of habitat specialists by generalists, endemic by large-ranged species, threatened by exotic species and species sensitive to human pressures by tolerant and anthropophilic species) with no effect on overall species richness, and a second phase (when human footprint >30) in a drop in overall species richness as many "winner" species are not benefiting human pressure anymore.

During my Masters, I worked on a theoretical model exploring the balance between human demography, land-use and ecosystem services [(Cazalis et al. 2018, Sci.Tot.Env)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.03.360)

I have been also involved, providing statistical support, in a review of the global tracking effort on seabirds, in which we identify species that have never or rarely been tracked and for which the knowledge, on migration and wintering behaviours, is lacking (**Bernard et al. *Under review***).
